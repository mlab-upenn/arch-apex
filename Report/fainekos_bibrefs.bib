  Abstract                 = {Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods are a popular class of methods for nonlinearly constrained optimization. They are particularly effective for solving a sequence of related problems, such as those arising in mixed-integer nonlinear programming and the optimization of functions subject to differential equation constraints. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the formulation of stabilized SQP methods, which are specifically designed to handle degenerate optimization problems. Existing stabilized SQP methods are essentially local in the sense that both the formulation and analysis focus on the properties of the methods in a neighborhood of a solution. A new SQP method is proposed that has favorable global convergence properties yet, under suitable assumptions, is equivalent to a variant of the conventional stabilized SQP method in the neighborhood of a solution. The method combines a primal-dual generalized augmented Lagrangian function with a flexible line search to obtain a sequence of improving estimates of the solution. The method incorporates a convexification algorithm that allows the use of exact second derivatives to define a convex quadratic programming (QP) subproblem without requiring that the Hessian of the Lagrangian be positive definite in the neighborhood of a solution. This gives the potential for fast convergence in the neighborhood of a solution. Additional benefits of the method are that each QP subproblem is regularized and the QP subproblem always has a known feasible point. Numerical experiments are presented for a subset of the problems from the \textttCUTEr test collection.

  Abstract                 = {We define robust timed automata, which are timed automata that accept all trajectories “robustly��?: if a robust timed automaton accepts a trajectory, then it must accept neighboring trajectories also; and if a robust timed automaton rejects a trajectory, then it must reject neighboring trajectories also. We show that the emptiness problem for robust timed automata is still decidable, by modifying the region construction for timed automata. We then show that, like timed automata, robust timed automata cannot be determinized. This result is somewhat unexpected, given that in temporal logic, the removal of realtime equality constraints is known to lead to a decidable theory that is closed under all boolean operations.},
  Description              = {For a given timed automaon A, first define a trajectory s, then a metric on the trajectory language L(A), the corresponding topology, then the tube language [L(A)] which is the set of open tubes O such that L(A) is dense in O. Prove some properties for it. Then generalize slightly to hybrid (not just timed) automata in Section 6, where the distance metric is the Haussdorf distance between the two trajectories (viewed as sets \{(t,x(t))\}). Kosentini and Caspi show in their FORMATS2004 paper on voting that their Skorokhod topology is finer than the tube topology.},

  Description              = {A specification template (or PSTL formula) is an STL formula with some constants replaced by paramaters. The idea is to find the parameters such that a given set of traces satisfies the formula with those params. This is requirements mining. They define monotonous formulas (whose robustness is monotonous w.r.t. one or more params), and develop a binary search for finding the tightest parameter values such that the formula is satisfied. Monotonicity can be verified via an SMT solver. This is the paper that introduces NM as a falsification algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we introduce a variant of temporal logic tailored for specifying desired properteis of continuous signals. The logic is based on a bounded subset of the real-time logic MITL, augmented with a static mapping from continuous domains into propositions. From formulae in this logic we create automatically property monitors that can check whether a given signal of bounded length and finite variability satisfies the property. A prototype implementation of this procedure was used to check properties of simulation traces generated by Matlab/Simulink.}

Since such a function may have many local minima, finding the global minimum is a computationally difficult problem. In this bibliographic survey, which includes most of the recent papers on constrained global concave minimization, we have attempted to briefly summarize the main ideas in each paper. These recent papers include those concerned with large scale global concave minimization and bilinear programming.},

The method is based on an effective combination of robot motion planning and model checking. Experiments on a hybrid robotic system benchmark with nonlinear dynamics show significant speedup over related work. The experiments also indicate significant speedup when using minimized DFA instead of non-minimized NFA, as obtained by standard tools, for representing the violating prefixes of φ.},
